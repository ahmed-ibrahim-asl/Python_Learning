# Functions: Is a block of code designed to perform a specific task, and it only when its called. 

# Function definition:  where the function's implementation resided is also accurate and an important aspect of understanding functions.
# Functions parameters: 



# Functions parameters: variables that are declared in the function definition. They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function when the function is called.
# Arguments: Arguments: Arguments are the actual values that are passed to the function when it is called.

# syntax of function 



def sum(number1, number2):
    return number1 + number2

print(sum(1,2))



# scope concept 
'''
a = 1
def conf():
    a = 5
    return a 

print(a)
print(confusion())


at the end it checks for built-in functions

we use global keyword to refers to global 
variable without need to create new variable




nonlocal - refers to not global variable and not global variable
