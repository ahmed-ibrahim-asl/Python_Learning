# Looping in Python is a fundaemntal concept used to execute a block of code
# repeatly under certain conditions.

# In python we have looping statments like

# for-loops:   iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, dictionary, set, string)
# while-loops: execute a block of code as long as a condition is true


# [ Loop Control Statements ] :
# break - exits the loop immediately
# continue skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.


# range syntax:
# range(start, stop, step)


# iterable - means something we can iterate over
# (iterable - list, dictionary, tuple, set, string)


# if i don't want to use variable to tell people i don't care about that variable
# for _ in range():


# [[ Do you know enumerate() ?]]
# uncomment the given example

# for index, char in enumerate("Hello"):
#     print(index, char )
