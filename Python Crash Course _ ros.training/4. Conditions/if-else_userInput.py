# Let's see how can we take input from the user so we can do tests on it 
# To do it we use input function and then we pass the prompt we want to display 
# for the user to guide him/her to pass the needed input
# note: the type of the data we get in return is string you can cast it to another type if you want

userInput = input("Enter: ")
print(type(userInput))
