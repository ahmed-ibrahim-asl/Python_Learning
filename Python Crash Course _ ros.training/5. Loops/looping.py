# Looping in Python is a fundaemntal concept used to execute a block of code
# repeatly under certain conditions. 

# In python we have looping statments like 

# for-loops:   iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, dictionary, set, string)
# while-loops: execute a block of code as long as a condition is true


# [ Loop Control Statements ] :
# break - exits the loop immediately
# continue skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.


# range syntax:
# range(start, step, stop)
